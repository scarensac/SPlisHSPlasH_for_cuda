This project is build from the SPlisHSPlasH framework:
https://github.com/InteractiveComputerGraphics/SPlisHSPlasH

Modification are made to implement the DFSPH algorithm on gpu.

This project requires CUDA in top of the requirements of the original project.

Note:
this project still use the mass based impelmentation and not the volume based implementation currently used in the splishsplash project for the multifluid systems
